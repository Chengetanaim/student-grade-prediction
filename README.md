# Student grade prediction

Predicting a student's final grade using the linear regression model.

## What I learnt:

- data cleaning using Pandas, removing NA values
- model creation using the scikit's learn Linear Regression model
- printing out the accuracy of the model by testing the X-test data set on the model
